# RedHen Notes

## Description

The RedHen Notes module allows you to add notes to contact and organization entities in your CRM. Since "note" is an entity bundle, RedHen notes are technically fieldable, though at this time is is no UI for adding additional fields.

This module optionally integrates with the RedHen Engagement Score module. See that module's README.txt for more information.
